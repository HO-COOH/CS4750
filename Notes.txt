    Intelligent Agent
        definition: An Intelligent agent perceives its environment via sensors and acts rationally upon that environment with its actuators
        examples: Human
        Agent Function: Maps percept (P) sequences to actions (A)
            f: P* -> A
        Agent program: Runs on the physical architecture to produce f
        Rationality: Performance measure, Prior environment knowledge, Actions, Percept sequence to date (sensors)
            A rational agent chooses whichever action maximizes the expected value of the performance measures given the percept sequence to date and prior environment knowledge
        Agent types:
            Table-Driven agent:
                lookup(percepts, table)->action
                return action
            Simple reflex agents:
            Model-based agents:
            Goal-based agents:
            Learning agents:
2.searching method
    problem-splving agents:
        problem types:
            deterministic, fully observable                 -> single-state problem
            non-observable                                  -> conformation problem
            nondetermministic and/or partially observable   -> contingency problem
                percepts provide new information about current state
            unknown state space                             -> exploration problem

    Tree search algorithm:
        function Tree-Search(problem, strategy) retuns a solution or failure
            initialize the search tree using the initial state of problem
            loop:
                if there are no candidates for expansion then return failure
                choose a leaf node for expansion according to strategy
                if 
                    the node contains a goal state then return the corresponding solution
                else
                    expand the node and add the resulting nodes to the search tree
