1. HW2: Maximize the reward of a vacuum cleaner with 4 searching algorithms:
   - uniform cost tree search
   - uniform cost graph search
   - depth-limited depth-first tree search
   - depth-limited depth-first graph search
2. HW4: Use the minimax algorithm to find the optimal moves for a game of Nim
3. HW6: Use backtracking search to to solve the Boolean satisfiability problem.
